What are the basic requirements to tackle next?

- Users must log in to use the service, that way we know which events to display, who is allowed to add other users to events, and who created an event.
    - Basic Auth and Registration
    - User persistance (store as JSON on-disk, stub out for DB integration later)
    - Login and Registration Page
        - On successful login, redirect to main page as specific user
    - When a user first attempts to access any page on the site, we do an auth check. If they are not currently authed, redirect to login/registration.
        - Cache auth (research methods, cookies, session persistance, etc)
    - Basic Auth can be stubbed out to prepare for real auth later. For practicality's sake, we just need a way to login and create new users.
- Users may create, update, and delete events, as well as viewing them. Full CRUD operations on events should be implemented.
    - Create new event button on main page -> opens up event manager
        - Event manager is a card with fields available to enter event information
        - Additionally, user names may be entered (name will be searched, dropdown presented of
            all matching users that are available as friends, click to finalize selection)
        - Usernames will be interactable with an X to remove them from the event
    - Edit button on event cards that opens up the event in the event manager
    - Delete button on event cards provides a prompt of Are You Sure? Then deletes the event
    - Basic storage - store as JSON on-disk, stub out for DB integration later

Future Ideas
- User profile configuration, user profile image uploads. 
- Creation of bands with X users in them, so that those users can be added to an event as a group rather than individually keyed. 
- Push notifications via email when event is scheduled/coming up. 
- Site settings that users can set for things like turning notifications on/off. 
- Band/User profiles that are viewable by other users. 
- Public/Private/Friends profile settings so that a person or band's profile can be viewable by anyone logged in, not viewable by anyone, or viewable only by friends.
